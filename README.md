🍞 SJC Bakery Analytics Suite
Monte Carlo Simulations for Strategic Decisions
Welcome to the SJC Bakery Analytics Suite, a data-driven decision-support tool designed specifically for bakeries aiming to optimize operations and reduce uncertainty. This suite leverages Monte Carlo simulations to model real-world variables—such as ingredient costs, demand fluctuations, and production times—helping bakery managers make more informed, strategic decisions.

🎯 Key Features
Monte Carlo Simulation Engine: Perform thousands of simulations to assess risk and variability in production and sales outcomes.

Customizable Input Variables: Define probability distributions for demand, ingredient costs, machine breakdowns, and more.

Visual Output & Dashboards: Interactive charts and histograms to understand risk ranges, confidence intervals, and expected profit margins.

Scenario Planning: Compare outcomes under different strategic choices (e.g., pricing strategies, supplier changes).

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with ease of use in mind for small business owners and bakery managers.

🧠 Use Cases
Forecasting profitability under uncertain demand

Evaluating the impact of ingredient price volatility

Planning capacity expansions or equipment investments

Estimating likelihood of meeting holiday production targets

📊 Tech Stack
Python (core simulation engine)

NumPy, SciPy, Pandas (statistical modeling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (data visualization)

Tkinter / Streamlit (GUI options depending on deployment needs)
